# Coffee Machine Program using Object Oriented Programming

Welcome to the Coffee Machine Game! â˜•ðŸŽ®

This project is a simple yet engaging Python-based simulation game where you take on the role of managing a coffee machine. 
This is an imitation of previous project "TheCoffeeMaker" but with smarter approach using object oriented programming.
Your goal is to make coffee orders and keep customers happy! 
It's an excellent exercise in object-oriented programming (OOP), with practical use of classes, methods, and data manipulation.
