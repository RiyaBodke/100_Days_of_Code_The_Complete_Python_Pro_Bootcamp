# Coffee Machine Program using Object Oriented Programming

Welcome to the Coffee Machine Game! ☕🎮

This project is a simple yet engaging Python-based simulation game where you take on the role of managing a coffee machine. 
This is an imitation of the previous project "TheCoffeeMaker" but with a smarter approach using object-oriented programming.
Your goal is to make coffee orders and keep customers happy! 
It's an excellent exercise in object-oriented programming (OOP), with practical use of classes, methods, and data manipulation.

## Features :
Interactive Gameplay: Simulate a working coffee machine and fulfil customer orders.
Multiple Coffee Types: Create various coffee drinks such as espresso, latte, cappuccino, and more.
Resource Management: Keep track of ingredients like water, coffee, milk, and money.
Object-Oriented Design: The game is built using Python classes, methods, and object-oriented programming principles.
User Input: Players input their decisions through the console, making the game interactive and fun.
